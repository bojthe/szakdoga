# Tello position correction

This project harbors code for a POC about real-time position correction based on visual input for indoor minidrone navigation.

The project uses Opencv, PIL and Tello_Async. These dependencies should be installed before running the code.
Before use, the desired QR codes should be printed and mounted in the environment, the drone is gonna navigate in.

When all of these are met, the procedure is ready to use.
